Mardi Gras with a crew is an entirely different experience than going solo. More people means more fun—but also more logistics. Here's how to coordinate a group without losing anyone in the chaos.

---

## The Mardi Gras Group Advantage

Why bring a crew to Mardi Gras?

- **Parade spots** — Large groups can stake out prime locations
- **Safety in numbers** — The crowds are massive; stay together
- **Cost savings** — Private houses split 15 ways are cheaper than hotels
- **Better parties** — Your own space for pre-gaming and recovery
- **Shared experiences** — Inside jokes for years

The challenge: Mardi Gras is chaotic by design. Planning is essential.

## Step 1: Pick Your Dates Wisely

Mardi Gras isn't one day—it's a season. When you go matters.

### The Key Dates (2026)

| Day | Date | What's Happening |
|-----|------|------------------|
| Thursday | Feb 12 | Parades start rolling Uptown |
| Friday | Feb 13 | Krewe of Hermes, Le Krewe d'Etat |
| Saturday | Feb 14 | Krewe of Endymion (massive) |
| Sunday | Feb 15 | Bacchus (celebrity king) |
| Lundi Gras | Feb 16 | Proteus, Orpheus |
| **Mardi Gras** | **Feb 17** | Zulu, Rex, truck parades |
| Ash Wednesday | Feb 18 | It's over. City recovers. |

### Which Days to Attend?

**Full Experience (5-6 days):** Thursday through Tuesday
- See the build-up, the peak, and the finale
- Expensive but worth it for the real experience

**Long Weekend (3-4 days):** Friday through Monday or Saturday through Tuesday
- Catch the major parades
- Miss some early ones but see the climax

**Quick Hit (2-3 days):** Saturday through Monday
- Endymion, Bacchus, and Lundi Gras
- Mardi Gras day is Tuesday—decide if you can extend

**Mardi Gras Day Only:** Tuesday
- You'll see the end but miss the build-up
- Better than nothing, but not the full experience

### Our Recommendation for Groups

**Arrive Friday, Leave Wednesday.** This gives you:
- Time to settle in before the chaos
- All the major parades
- Mardi Gras day
- A recovery day before traveling

---

## Step 2: Book Early—Very Early

### Housing Timeline

| When | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 6-9 months before | Best houses available, best prices |
| 3-6 months before | Good options, prices rising |
| 1-3 months before | Slim pickings, premium prices |
| Last minute | Good luck |

**For groups of 10+, book 6+ months ahead.** The best properties go fast.

### Why Private Houses Beat Hotels

| Factor | Private House | Hotel |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Space for 15 | One house | 5-7 rooms on different floors |
| Pre-game space | Living room, yard | Hotel lobby (no) |
| Recovery space | Pool, porch | Your tiny room |
| Cost per person | $150-300/night | $300-500/night (Mardi Gras rates) |
| Parade access | Walk outside | Uber through traffic |

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Crew Systems

### Communication

**Create the group chat 6+ months out.** Use:
- WhatsApp (best for polls, works on all phones)
- iMessage (if everyone has iPhones)
- A dedicated Slack channel (for organized crews)

### Money Management

**Use Splitwise.** Seriously. It automatically tracks:
- Who paid for what
- Who owes whom
- Running balances

Settle up daily or it becomes a mess.

### Collect Deposits Early

| Payment | When | Amount |
|---------|------|--------|
| Deposit | At commitment | $200-250 |
| Balance | 2 months before | Remaining housing |
| Activity fund | 2 weeks before | $100-150 for group supplies |

**Non-refundable deposits prevent dropouts.**

---

## Step 4: Assign Roles

### Essential Positions

**The Organizer**
- Books housing
- Collects money
- Creates itinerary
- Makes final calls

**The Advance Team (2-3 people)**
- Arrives 1 day early
- Stocks house with supplies
- Sets up home base
- Secures parade equipment (ladders, chairs, etc.)

**The Parade Captain**
- Knows the parade routes
- Picks viewing spots
- Gets the crew there on time
- Brings the parade supplies

**The Navigator**
- Coordinates transportation
- Keeps track of everyone
- Sets rally points
- Handles lost crew members

**The Documenter**
- Takes photos/videos
- Creates shared album
- Posts the group updates

---

## Step 5: The Money Breakdown

### Sample Budget (15 people, 5 nights)

| Expense | Total Cost | Per Person (15) |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| House rental | $7,500 | $500 |
| Groceries/drinks (house) | $800 | $53 |
| Parade supplies | $300 | $20 |
| Group meals (2) | $1,200 | $80 |
| Uber/transportation | $400 | $27 |
| **Group Costs** | **$10,200** | **$680** |

**Individual costs (add separately):**
- Flights: $200-500
- Personal food/drinks: $200-400
- Souvenirs/beads: $50-100

**Total per person: $1,100-1,500** for a 5-night Mardi Gras experience.

---

## Step 6: Parade Strategy for Groups

### Picking Your Spot

**Uptown Route (St. Charles Ave):**
- More space, family-friendly
- Best for: daytime parades, seeing the full route
- Stake out spots early for big parades

**Downtown Route (Canal St):**
- More crowded, more intense
- Best for: night parades, being in the action
- Harder to keep groups together

**Mid-City (Endymion route):**
- Local favorite
- Best for: Endymion specifically
- Less touristy feel

### Group Parade Protocol

1. **Pick a meeting spot** — Specific corner, specific side of street
2. **Arrive 2-3 hours early** for big parades (Endymion, Bacchus, Zulu)
3. **Bring supplies:**
   - Folding chairs
   - Cooler with drinks and snacks
   - Bags for catching throws
   - Portable phone chargers
   - Rain gear (just in case)

4. **Set a rally point** — If anyone gets separated, where do they go?
5. **Share locations** — Everyone shares their phone location for the weekend

### The Buddy System

Mardi Gras crowds are dense. Set rules:
- No one leaves alone
- Bathroom trips in pairs minimum
- Set check-in times if you split up
- Everyone knows the house address by heart

---

## Step 7: House Rules for Mardi Gras

### Survival Basics

**Hydration Station:** Stock the house with:
- Cases of water
- Gatorade/electrolytes
- Pedialyte (no shame)

**Food Stockpile:**
- Breakfast supplies (eggs, bacon, bread)
- Snacks (chips, fruit, protein bars)
- Late-night food (frozen pizza, easy stuff)

**Recovery Zone:**
- Designate quiet hours (3am-10am)
- Have a "chill room" for people who need a break
- First aid kit with basics + aspirin/ibuprofen

### Rotation Schedule

Not everyone needs to do every parade. Create a rough schedule:

```
FRIDAY
======
Day parade: Full crew
Night parade: Most people
Late night: Whoever's standing

SATURDAY (Endymion)
===================
Recovery morning: Sleep in
Pre-parade: Pool/house hang
Endymion: ALL HANDS ON DECK
After: Optional French Quarter

SUNDAY (Bacchus)
================
Brunch crew: Early risers
Pool crew: Recovery mode
Bacchus: Full crew rallies
```

Let people opt out. Forcing exhausted people to parade isn't fun for anyone.

## Step 8: Transportation During Mardi Gras

### The Reality

- Many streets are **closed** for parades
- Ubers are **expensive** and **slow**
- Traffic is **nightmarish**

### Solutions

**Walk:** If you're staying Uptown or in the Quarter, walk to parades.

**Bike:** Rent bikes for getting around. Faster than cars during Mardi Gras.

**Streetcar:** The St. Charles line runs along the parade route. Slow but scenic.

**Rideshare Strategy:**
- Order well before you need to leave
- Set pickup points away from parade routes
- Expect surge pricing (2-3x normal)
- Budget $50-100/person for the week

**Best approach:** Stay somewhere walkable to the parades you care most about.

---

## Step 9: What Goes Wrong

### Someone Gets Lost

- **Share phone locations** with the whole group before day one
- Set a **rally point** at the house if all else fails
- **Text, don't call** — texts get through when calls don't

### Someone Goes Too Hard

- Mardi Gras is a marathon, not a sprint
- Pace yourselves—it's multiple days
- Keep water everywhere
- Know the signs of heat exhaustion and alcohol poisoning

### Weather

- Check the forecast, but know it can change
- Pack layers and rain gear
- Parades roll rain or shine (mostly)
- Cold snaps happen—bring a jacket

### House Issues

- Get the property manager's number
- Know where the breaker box is
- Have plungers in every bathroom
- Report damage immediately
