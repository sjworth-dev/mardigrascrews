Mardi Gras isn't a party. It's a marathon of parties. Here's how to do it right without dying.

---

## The Basics

### When Is Mardi Gras?

Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) falls 47 days before Easter. It moves every year:

- **2026:** February 17
- **2027:** February 9
- **2028:** February 29
- **2029:** February 13

The "season" runs from January 6 (Twelfth Night) through Fat Tuesday, but the big parades happen the two weeks before.

### The Must-Know Days

**Thursday before Mardi Gras:** Major parades start (Muses)
**Friday:** Hermes, Le Krewe d'Etat
**Saturday:** Endymion (massive)
**Sunday:** Bacchus (celebrity king)
**Monday (Lundi Gras):** Orpheus, Proteus
**Fat Tuesday:** Zulu, Rex, walking parades, total chaos

## Where to Be

### Parade Routes

Most major parades follow similar routes:

**Uptown Route:** St. Charles Avenue from Napoleon to Canal Street
- Best for: Families, catching throws, real NOLA experience
- Vibe: More local, less chaotic

**Mid-City Route:** Orleans Avenue, turns on Canal
- Best for: Endymion specifically
- Vibe: Huge crowds, party atmosphere

**French Quarter:** Rex enters on Canal, walking parades throughout
- Best for: Fat Tuesday specifically
- Vibe: Maximum chaos, tourist-heavy

### Where to Watch

**St. Charles Avenue** (between Napoleon and Louisiana)
- Classic parade experience
- Bring your own chairs, ladders for kids
- Arrive 2-3 hours early for good spots

**Canal Street** at St. Charles
- Major intersection, lots of action
- Standing room only, very crowded
- Best for first-timers who want the full chaos

**Magazine Street**
- Smaller, quirky parades
- More local vibe
- Great for the 'Tit Rex parade

## Survival Tips

### Pacing Yourself

This is the #1 mistake people make. Mardi Gras is a marathon:

- **Start slow:** First few days, don't go too hard
- **Hydrate:** Seriously. Water between drinks.
- **Eat real food:** Not just parade snacks
- **Take breaks:** Go home, rest, come back
- **Save energy for Tuesday:** That's the main event

### What to Wear

- **Comfortable shoes:** You'll walk miles
- **Layers:** Mornings are cold, afternoons warm up
- **Costumes encouraged:** Get creative, especially on Fat Tuesday
- **Purple, green, gold:** Mandatory
- **Nothing you care about:** It will get dirty

### What to Bring

- **Cash:** Many vendors are cash-only
- **Portable charger:** Your phone will die
- **Small bag/fanny pack:** Keep essentials close
- **Sunscreen:** Even in February
- **Hand sanitizer:** Trust us

### What NOT to Bring

- **Valuables:** Leave them at the house
- **Glass:** Prohibited at parades
- **Coolers on wheels:** Prohibited in French Quarter
- **Bad attitude:** Leave it at home

## The Do's and Don'ts

### DO:
- Book accommodations 6-12 months ahead
- Learn to say "throw me something, mister!"
- Try a king cake (the one with the baby)
- Watch Zulu (earliest parade on Tuesday, unique throws)
- Stay for Rex (noon on Tuesday, traditional)
- Explore beyond Bourbon Street

### DON'T:
- Drive anywhere during Mardi Gras
- Flash for beads (it's actually rare outside Bourbon)
- Get separated from your group without a plan
- Forget to pace yourself
- Wait until the last minute to book
- Sleep through Zulu (you'll regret it)

---

## Food & Drink Strategy

### The Classics to Try

- **King Cake:** It's everywhere. Randazzo's and Dong Phuong are favorites
- **Crawfish:** Season starts around Mardi Gras
- **Gumbo:** Every restaurant has a version
- **Po'boys:** Parkway, Domilise's, Crabby Jack's

### Drinking Strategy

The city is wet—you can drink anywhere:

- **Go-cups:** Bars will put your drink in a to-go cup
- **Hand Grenades:** The tourist trap drink (strong)
- **Hurricanes:** Pat O'Brien's is the original
- **Local beer:** Abita, Urban South, Courtyard

### Eating During Parades

- **Vendors everywhere:** Hot dogs, jambalaya, etc.
- **Bring snacks:** Stock a backpack
- **Restaurant reservations:** Hard to get, book ahead or eat early/late

---

## Getting Around

### Transportation

- **Walk:** Best option for most things
- **Uber/Lyft:** Surge pricing is insane, plan accordingly
- **Streetcar:** St. Charles line is useful, but slow during parades
- **Don't drive:** Parking is impossible, streets close

### The French Quarter During Mardi Gras

On Fat Tuesday, the Quarter is a zoo:

- **Bourbon Street:** Maximum chaos, shoulder-to-shoulder
- **Royal Street:** Slightly less insane
- **Frenchmen Street:** More locals, still packed

## Safety

### General Tips

- **Stay with your group:** Designate meeting points
- **Keep phone charged:** For finding each other
- **Watch your drinks:** Standard bar safety
- **Trust your instincts:** If something feels off, leave
- **Know your limits:** Help is available, ask

### If You Get Separated

- **Have a meeting spot:** Agree in advance (your house, a specific corner)
- **Share locations:** Use Find My Friends or equivalent
- **Have the address:** Everyone should know where you're staying

## Budget Reality Check

Mardi Gras is expensive. Expect:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Accommodations (group split) | $200-400/person |
| Food (5 days) | $200-300/person |
| Drinks | $150-300/person |
| Ubers (if any) | $50-100/person |
| **Total** | **$600-1,100/person** |

This assumes you're staying in a group property and not going crazy. Hotels and last-minute bookings cost significantly more.
